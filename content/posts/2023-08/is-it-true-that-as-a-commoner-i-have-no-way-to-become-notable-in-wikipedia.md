Is it true that as a commoner, I have no way to become notable in Wikipedia?

## ChatGPT
No, that is not true. While it may be challenging for someone without significant achievements or public recognition to have a Wikipedia page dedicated solely to them, it does not mean that common individuals cannot become notable on Wikipedia. Wikipedia's notability guidelines state that individuals may be considered notable if they have made significant contributions or achievements in a particular field, have received significant coverage in reliable sources, or have had a major impact on society or culture.

Becoming notable on Wikipedia typically requires making a notable contribution or achieving recognition in a specific domain, such as academia, arts, sports, politics, or other fields. For instance, if you excel in a particular field, publish significant research, win notable awards, or play a crucial role in a significant event, you may have the potential to meet the notability criteria.

It's important to note that notability on Wikipedia is determined by the community of editors based on the available sources and the overall significance of an individual's contributions. If you believe you meet the notability guidelines, you can gather reliable sources that demonstrate your accomplishments or impact and present them to the Wikipedia community for consideration.

4. Leadership roles or significant positions: Hold important leadership positions in organizations or institutions, especially if your work has a broader impact or influence on society or culture.

It's essential to provide reliable sources that establish your notability and demonstrate that your accomplishments have received attention and recognition from independent sources.

2. Advocacy and activism: Engage in meaningful advocacy work or activism for a cause that has gained attention and recognition.

3. Community leadership and service: Contribute to your local community or a specific social group in a notable way. This could include volunteering, organizing impactful events, or leading initiatives that address pressing community needs. If your contributions have garnered recognition or have been covered by local media, it can strengthen your case for notability.
4. Cultural or subcultural contributions: Make notable contributions to a specific culture, subculture, or niche interest. This could involve creating influential content, organizing events, or actively participating in communities related to art, music, literature, gaming, fandoms, or other specialized areas.
5. Notable online presence: Build a substantial online presence through platforms such as YouTube, blogs, podcasts, or social media. If your content or online activities have gained a significant following or have been recognized by independent sources, it can contribute to your notability.

Remember, becoming notable on Wikipedia is ultimately determined by the community of editors based on the available evidence and the significance of your contributions or impact. While it may require some effort and recognition, there are diverse paths to notability, and each individual's journey is unique.

How many living persons with Wikipedia page compared to the number of person living today?

## ChatGPT
As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time data or statistics. However, as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, it is estimated that there were over 7.9 billion people living on Earth. The exact number of individuals with Wikipedia pages for living persons is constantly changing due to new articles being created and existing ones being updated or removed.

While I don't have the precise figures, it's important to note that not every living person will have a Wikipedia page. Wikipedia's notability guidelines require individuals to meet certain criteria, such as significant achievements, coverage in reliable sources, or impact on society, in order to have a dedicated article. Therefore, the number of living persons with Wikipedia pages is likely to be significantly smaller than the total number of people living today.
