If I inserted leap seconds on NIST, did I technically created "time?"

Inserting leap seconds into the timekeeping system maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) would not mean that you have created "time" itself. Time is a fundamental concept that exists independently of any specific human measurement or timekeeping system.

Leap seconds are inserted into Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to account for irregularities in the Earth's rotation. UTC is an internationally recognized time standard that provides a consistent reference for timekeeping across different regions and systems. Leap seconds are introduced periodically to ensure that UTC stays in sync with the Earth's rotation, which can vary slightly over time.

While the addition of leap seconds is a necessary adjustment for accurate timekeeping, it does not imply the creation of time itself. Time is a natural phenomenon that exists regardless of our measurements or adjustments. Our timekeeping systems are merely tools we use to measure and synchronize our activities with the passage of time.
