## You
If a bird got ingested on turbofan engine, it is called a bird strike, what about if an airport worker got ingested on turbofan engine, is that called a "worker strike"?

## ChatGPT
No, the term "worker strike" is not used to describe a situation in which an airport worker gets ingested into a turbofan engine. The term "bird strike" specifically refers to a collision between an aircraft and a bird during flight, particularly when the bird is sucked into the engine. This term is used because bird strikes are relatively common occurrences in aviation and have specific protocols and procedures associated with them.

If an airport worker were to be involved in an incident with a turbofan engine, it would likely be considered an industrial accident or an occupational safety incident. The specific terminology used would depend on the circumstances and the industry standards in place.
