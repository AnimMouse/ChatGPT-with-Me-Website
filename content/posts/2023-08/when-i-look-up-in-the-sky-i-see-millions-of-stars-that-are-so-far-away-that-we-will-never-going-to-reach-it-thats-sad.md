When I look up in the sky, I see millions of stars that are so far away that we will never going to reach it, that's sad.

It can be awe-inspiring to look up at the stars and contemplate the vastness of the universe. While it's true that many of the stars we see in the night sky are incredibly far away and may never be reachable with current technology, it's important to remember that there is still so much to explore and discover in our own solar system and beyond.

Additionally, the study of astronomy and astrophysics can help us better understand the nature of the universe and our place within it. Through research and observation, scientists have been able to uncover incredible insights into the workings of the cosmos, from the behavior of distant galaxies to the properties of individual stars and planets.

Rather than focusing on the unreachable, we can embrace the wonder of the universe and continue to explore and learn as much as we can about the mysteries of the cosmos. Who knows what amazing discoveries we may make in the future!
