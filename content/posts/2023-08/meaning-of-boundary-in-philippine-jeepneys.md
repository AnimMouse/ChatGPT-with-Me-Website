## ChatGPT
In the context of Philippine jeepneys, the term "boundary" refers to the fare or fee that a jeepney driver needs to collect from passengers during a single trip. Jeepneys are a popular mode of public transportation in the Philippines, known for their vibrant decorations and unique designs.

Jeepney drivers typically do not receive fixed salaries. Instead, they operate on a system known as the "boundary system." Under this system, the driver is responsible for paying a fixed amount, known as the boundary, to the jeepney owner or operator. The driver keeps any amount collected from passengers above the boundary as their earnings for the day.

The boundary serves as a way for the jeepney owner to cover the vehicle's expenses, such as fuel, maintenance, and other operational costs. The driver's ability to earn more money depends on how many passengers they can pick up and the total fare they collect during their shift.

While the boundary system has been criticized for its potential to encourage reckless driving or overloading of passengers to maximize earnings, it has been a long-standing practice in the jeepney industry in the Philippines. However, it's worth noting that efforts have been made to transition to a more formalized and regulated fare collection system to ensure passenger safety and welfare.
