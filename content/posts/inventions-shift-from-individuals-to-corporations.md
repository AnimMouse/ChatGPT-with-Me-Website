Back then, inventions are credited to single individuals, like Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell, nowadays, inventions are credited to organizations and corporations like Intel and Google, what are the main driving force of this?

> The shift from individual inventors to corporate entities as the primary source of innovation can be attributed to several factors, including changes in the nature of innovation itself, the increasing complexity of technology, and the rise of globalization and the knowledge economy.
> 
> Firstly, innovation has become increasingly complex and multidisciplinary, requiring expertise and resources from multiple fields and disciplines. It's no longer possible for a single individual to master all the necessary knowledge and skills required to invent new technologies. Thus, the pooling of resources and expertise within organizations has become essential to drive innovation forward.
> 
> Secondly, the nature of innovation has changed from the invention of individual products to the development of integrated systems and platforms. This requires large investments in research and development, as well as ongoing maintenance and improvement. Corporations are better positioned to make these investments and sustain them over the long term, which is necessary for the success of such complex projects.
> 
> Thirdly, the rise of globalization and the knowledge economy has led to increased competition, which has pushed companies to invest heavily in research and development in order to stay ahead of their competitors. This has resulted in a growing emphasis on intellectual property and the need for corporations to protect their inventions through patents and other legal mechanisms.
> 
> Overall, while individual inventors still play a critical role in driving innovation, the complexity and scale of modern innovation have made it necessary for organizations and corporations to become the primary driving force behind new inventions.
