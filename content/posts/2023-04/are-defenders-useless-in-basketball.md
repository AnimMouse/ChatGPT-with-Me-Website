Are defenders in basketball virtually useless? They mostly can't steal the ball because of the rules, mostly a change of possession happen because of a shooting attempt.

> Defenders in basketball are certainly not useless. While it is true that the rules of the game make it more difficult for defenders to steal the ball, they still play a crucial role in defending against their opponents and preventing them from scoring.
> 
> Firstly, defenders are responsible for preventing their opponents from getting open shots. They use a variety of techniques such as guarding, blocking, and contesting to make it harder for the offensive player to make a shot. This is particularly important in preventing high-percentage shots, such as layups or dunks, which can be difficult to defend against once an offensive player is in close proximity to the basket.
> 
> Secondly, defenders also play a crucial role in rebounding, which is another key aspect of defense. When a shot is missed, defenders need to be in position to grab the rebound and prevent the opposing team from getting another opportunity to score. This requires physical strength, quickness, and a good sense of positioning.
> 
> Thirdly, defenders can also disrupt the flow of the opposing team's offense by forcing turnovers and creating fast break opportunities for their own team. While steals may be more difficult to come by, defenders can still force turnovers by contesting passes and disrupting the offensive player's rhythm.
> 
> In conclusion, defenders in basketball are far from useless. They play a critical role in preventing their opponents from scoring and contribute to a team's overall defensive strategy. While the rules of the game may limit their ability to steal the ball, they still have a significant impact on the outcome of a game.

Every time a defender tries to steal a ball, it is called a foul, it is like the rules of the basketball is skewed in favor of attackers.

> While it is true that defenders risk committing a foul when attempting to steal the ball, this does not necessarily mean that the rules of basketball are skewed in favor of attackers.
> 
> The rules of basketball are designed to maintain a fair and balanced game between the offense and defense. While the rules do give some advantages to the offensive player, such as the ability to shoot without interference or the ability to move freely without the ball, they also impose restrictions on the offense, such as the shot clock or the prohibition against traveling.
> 
> Regarding the issue of fouls, it is true that defenders risk committing a foul when attempting to steal the ball, especially if they make contact with the offensive player's hand or arm. However, this does not mean that all attempts to steal the ball will result in a foul. A skilled defender can learn to time their movements, anticipate their opponent's actions, and position themselves properly to minimize the risk of committing a foul.
> 
> It is also worth noting that fouls can be committed by offensive players as well, such as charging into a defender or pushing off to create space. In fact, offensive fouls are often called when an offensive player uses their body to gain an advantage over the defender.
> 
> In conclusion, while the rules of basketball may give some advantages to the offensive player, this does not mean that the game is skewed in their favor. The rules are designed to maintain a fair and balanced game between the offense and defense, and both sides have opportunities to make plays and contribute to the outcome of the game.

The rule that I really hate in basketball is the defensive 3 second violation, that rule basically prevents the defender from doing their job! Why we have that stupid rule?

> The defensive three-second violation rule is in place to prevent a defensive player from camping out in the paint for an extended period of time without actively guarding an offensive player. This rule was put in place to promote more movement and flow in the game and to prevent a defender from clogging up the key area and disrupting the offensive team's ability to drive to the basket or move the ball around the perimeter.
> 
> The rule requires that defensive players must be actively guarding an offensive player, either by closely marking them or actively trying to steal the ball, while inside the key area. If a defensive player is found to be in violation of the rule, it results in a technical foul and a free throw for the opposing team.
> 
> While it may seem like this rule prevents defenders from doing their job, it actually forces defenders to be more active and involved in the game. By requiring them to actively guard an offensive player, it forces them to engage with the offensive player, either by defending against them or trying to steal the ball, and prevents them from just standing in one spot.
> 
> Additionally, the rule promotes more movement and flow in the game, which makes it more exciting for fans to watch. It also helps prevent the game from becoming stagnant, with both teams just standing around in one area of the court.
> 
> In conclusion, while the defensive three-second violation rule may seem like it prevents defenders from doing their job, it actually promotes more activity and involvement from the defensive players, and helps keep the game moving and exciting for both players and fans.
