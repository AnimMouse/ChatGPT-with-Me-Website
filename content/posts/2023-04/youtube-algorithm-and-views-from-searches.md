I created a YouTube channel, and my content got a lot of views, I checked my statistics, and a majority of views are coming from searches instead of recommendation, does it mean the YouTube algorithm does not want my videos?

> Not necessarily. It's actually a good thing that your videos are being discovered through searches because it means that people are actively seeking out the content you create. It also means that your video titles, descriptions, and tags are optimized for search, which is an important factor in helping your content get discovered by new viewers.
> 
> While recommendations are also important, they tend to come into play more as viewers engage more with your content, which can lead to increased visibility over time. So, even if your videos aren't being heavily promoted through recommendations right now, it doesn't necessarily mean that the YouTube algorithm is against your content. Keep creating quality content, and over time, you may see more recommendations and increased engagement.

Does having less than 1k subscribers prevents the YouTube algorithm from recommending my content?

> Having less than 1,000 subscribers does not necessarily prevent the YouTube algorithm from recommending your content. While subscriber count is one factor that the algorithm considers when recommending videos, it's not the only factor. The algorithm also considers factors such as video engagement, watch time, and relevance to the viewer's interests.
> 
> If your content is engaging and relevant to viewers, and if viewers are spending time watching and engaging with your videos, then the algorithm may still recommend your content, regardless of your subscriber count. So, don't be discouraged by a low subscriber count. Keep creating quality content that resonates with your target audience, and the subscribers and views will come over time.

Does my video getting discovered from searches than recommendations actually a good thing? A lot of big YouTube channels like Mr. Beast gets their views from recommendations, not searches. Do you think people actively seeks Mr. Beast content instead of getting shown from recommendations?

> Yes, getting discovered from searches is actually a good thing because it means that people are actively seeking out your content. This indicates that your videos are optimized for search and are being discovered by viewers who are interested in the topics you cover. It also means that your video titles, descriptions, and tags are effective at communicating the content of your videos to viewers.
> 
> That being said, recommendations are also important because they help your content reach new viewers who may not have discovered your channel otherwise. However, it's important to note that the algorithms for recommending videos are complex and can be influenced by many factors, such as viewer behavior, engagement, and video metadata.
> 
> Regarding Mr. Beast, it's likely that a combination of search and recommendations are driving his views. While his channel is well-known and has a dedicated following, his videos are also likely being recommended to viewers who have shown an interest in similar content or who have engaged with his videos in the past. So, it's not necessarily that people are actively seeking out his content over being recommended it, but rather a combination of both.

Is there any big YouTube channels out there that thrives on viewers seeking your content? Most YouTube channels that get their views from searches are from "how to" channels like ChrisFix but they are no where as big as Mr. Beast.

> There are definitely big YouTube channels out there that have built their audience primarily through viewers seeking out their content. One example is Casey Neistat, who has over 12 million subscribers and is known for his vlogs and storytelling style. His videos often rank highly in search results due to his highly specific and searchable video titles and tags, which has helped him build a loyal following of viewers who actively seek out his content.
> 
> Another example is PewDiePie, who has over 110 million subscribers and is known for his commentary on gaming and internet culture. Although his channel has certainly benefited from recommendations over the years, PewDiePie has also built a dedicated audience of viewers who actively seek out his content due to his unique style and personality.
> 
> While "how-to" channels may be more commonly associated with viewers seeking out content, there are definitely big channels out there that have thrived due to viewers actively seeking out their content. The key is to create content that is highly searchable and resonates with your target audience, which can lead to increased views and engagement over time.
