In the Philippines, there are several stores that specialize in selling computer parts and accessories. However, there are no stores that operate on the same scale as Microcenter in the USA, where customers can purchase computer parts like groceries.

Some popular stores in the Philippines where you can purchase computer parts include:

But they don't sell PC parts like a grocery, they lock PC parts behind glass, unlike in Microcenter you can just grab it from the shelf and put it in your shopping cart.

You are correct that the shopping experience in the Philippines for computer parts and accessories is different from that of Microcenter in the USA. While some stores may have a more traditional retail setup where items are kept behind glass or in display cases, others may have items available for customers to pick up and place in their shopping carts.

Some stores may have a more casual browsing experience, while others may have a more formal setup. Additionally, some stores may have different policies and procedures for handling their inventory and merchandise.
