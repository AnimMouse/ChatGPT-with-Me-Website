_Prompt_: 
What does "no blood, no foul" means?

The phrase "no blood, no foul" is a colloquial expression that is often used to imply that a situation or event is not serious or consequential unless there is evidence of harm or injury. It is often used in informal settings, such as in sports or games, to suggest that unless there is clear and obvious harm or injury, no penalty or consequence should be imposed.

The phrase can also be interpreted more broadly to mean that unless there is tangible evidence of harm, damage, or wrongdoing, there is no need to take action or assign blame. It can be used to downplay the significance of a situation, suggesting that unless there are serious consequences, it is not worth worrying about or taking action upon.

It's worth noting that this phrase is often used in a casual or informal manner and may not be appropriate in more formal or serious situations where the consequences of an action or event are more significant. It is important to consider the context and tone when using or interpreting this phrase to avoid misunderstandings or miscommunication.

_Prompt_: 
Is it true that if violence does not leave a mark, it is hard to prove evidence for it?

Yes, it is generally true that if violence does not leave a visible physical mark, it can be challenging to provide concrete evidence of its occurrence. In legal and investigative contexts, visible injuries such as bruises, cuts, or other physical marks can serve as tangible evidence of violence and can support a victim's claim of being harmed. However, in cases where there are no visible marks, proving the occurrence of violence may rely on other forms of evidence, such as eyewitness accounts, testimonies, forensic evidence, or circumstantial evidence.

It's important to note that while physical evidence can be compelling, the absence of visible marks does not necessarily mean that violence did not occur. Forms of violence that do not leave physical marks, such as psychological or emotional abuse, can still have significant and lasting impacts on victims, even though they may not be immediately apparent. It is essential to consider the full range of evidence, including non-physical evidence, when investigating and addressing allegations of violence or abuse. Additionally, the interpretation and handling of evidence in legal contexts may vary depending on jurisdiction, laws, and legal procedures, and should be done by qualified professionals.
