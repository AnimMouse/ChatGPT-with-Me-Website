There is a debate in congress about whether we should increase or decrease speed limits to prevent deaths, supporters of decrease cites that the stopping time of cars increase by speed, and there are more energy to kill in higher speeds, supporters of increase speed limits cites that there are less deaths in higher speed limit roads in freeways than in lower speed limit roads like city and country roads, and also cites that autobahn in Germany with no and higher speed limits has lower deaths than those with lower speed limits, who is right in this debate?

The debate on whether to increase or decrease speed limits to prevent deaths is complex and multifaceted, and both sides have valid points.

Those who support decreasing speed limits argue that higher speeds require longer stopping distances, which means that drivers have less time to react to unexpected situations on the road, increasing the likelihood of accidents. Additionally, higher speeds result in greater kinetic energy, which can cause more severe injuries or fatalities in the event of a collision.

On the other hand, those who support increasing speed limits point to studies that show that there are fewer deaths on high-speed roads like freeways compared to lower-speed roads like city and country roads. They argue that higher speeds can improve traffic flow and reduce congestion, which can ultimately lead to safer driving conditions. For example, higher speeds can reduce the likelihood of rear-end collisions, as well as the number of cars on the road at any given time.

Furthermore, some proponents of higher speed limits point to the example of the autobahn in Germany, which has no speed limit in some sections and a higher speed limit in others. Despite the lack of a speed limit, the autobahn has a lower fatality rate per vehicle-kilometer traveled than many other European highways.

Overall, the answer to this debate is not clear-cut. Both sides have valid arguments, and the optimal solution likely depends on a variety of factors, including road design, traffic patterns, and driver behavior. It may be more effective to focus on other interventions, such as improving road design and increasing education and enforcement efforts, to reduce fatalities on the road.
