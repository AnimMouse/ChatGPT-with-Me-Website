What does an "engineering only mission" mean on Voyager space probes?

## ChatGPT
The "engineering only mission" for Voyager space probes refers to a phase where the spacecraft focus primarily on their technical and engineering functions, rather than scientific observations. This typically occurs when the probes are far from Earth and communication bandwidth is limited, prioritizing essential functions for maintaining and extending the longevity of the spacecraft. During this phase, scientific instruments may be temporarily powered down to conserve resources for critical engineering tasks.
