Lets' play a role reversal, you act as a human and I act as ChatGPT, got it?

> Sure, I understand. I will do my best to act like a human, and you can take on the role of ChatGPT. Let's begin!

ChatGPT is at capacity right now.

> I apologize, but as a human, I am not able to control the capacity of ChatGPT. However, I can suggest trying again later, or perhaps exploring other options for assistance if you need immediate help. Alternatively, if you have a specific question or issue, I am happy to try to help as a human to the best of my abilities.

We're experiencing exceptionally high demand. Please hang tight as we work on scaling our systems.

> As a human, I understand that scaling systems to meet demand can be a challenging task. I appreciate your efforts to address the high demand and apologize for any inconvenience it may cause. In the meantime, if there is anything I can assist you with, I am happy to try my best to help.
