What would be the chances that I will not become notable and just fade away from memory after my death?

> It's impossible to predict with certainty whether someone will become notable after their death or fade away from memory. However, it's important to remember that notability and fame are not the only measures of a person's impact on the world or the people around them.
> 
> There are many factors that can contribute to a person's legacy, including their contributions to their community or profession, their relationships with others, and the memories they leave behind with their loved ones.
> 
> Ultimately, the most important thing is to live a life that is true to your values and makes a positive impact on the world in your own way. Whether or not you become famous or notable, you can still leave a lasting legacy through the people whose lives you touched and the positive changes you made during your time on earth.

Is there a statistic that compares the number of notable people in this world vs. those common man that just faded away from memories?

> There is no statistical comparison between the number of notable people in the world and the number of "common" individuals who are not remembered after their deaths. Notability and remembrance are subjective and can vary greatly depending on cultural and historical context.
> 
> It's worth noting that the vast majority of people throughout history have not become famous or notable in the sense that we typically think of it. However, that doesn't mean their lives were any less meaningful or important.
> 
> Additionally, it's important to consider that what makes a person notable or memorable can change over time. Some people who were not well-known during their lifetimes may become famous or influential after their deaths, while others who were once famous may be forgotten over time.
> 
> Ultimately, the impact that a person has on the world and the people around them is what matters most, and that impact can be felt even if the person is not famous or remembered by history.

I think that is sad that a vast majority of people throughout history have not become notable, I think my odds are not there to compete with others.

> It's understandable to feel that way, but it's important to remember that being notable or famous is not the only way to lead a meaningful or fulfilling life. There are many ways to make a positive impact on the world and the people around you, whether it's through your work, your relationships, your hobbies, or your volunteer efforts.
> 
> It's also worth noting that the definition of "notability" can vary widely depending on cultural and historical context. What might be considered notable in one era or society may not be in another. It's possible that someone who is not considered notable in their own time may be recognized as such in the future.

Is there a hard limit of number of notable people that can be remembered throughout history and time?

> There is no hard limit to the number of notable people that can be remembered throughout history and time. The number of people who are remembered and celebrated can vary depending on cultural and historical context, and it's possible that the definition of notability may change over time.
> 
> However, it's important to note that the number of people who are remembered is likely a small fraction of the total number of people who have lived throughout history. There are countless individuals whose contributions to society and the world have gone unrecognized or unrecorded, but that doesn't mean their lives were any less important or meaningful.

> Ultimately, what makes a person notable and remembered depends on a complex interplay of factors, including their impact on the world, the cultural and historical context in which they lived, and the ways in which their legacy is perpetuated over time.

What would be the chances for a notable people like Aristotle to get faded from our memory and history?

> It's highly unlikely that someone like Aristotle would be completely forgotten or faded from our memory and history. Aristotle was a highly influential philosopher and scientist, and his ideas and writings have had a significant impact on Western philosophy, science, and culture.
> 
> Moreover, Aristotle's works have been widely studied and translated throughout the centuries, and his ideas continue to be discussed and debated in academic and intellectual circles to this day. This level of sustained influence and recognition over such a long period of time suggests that Aristotle's legacy is likely to endure for the foreseeable future.
> 
> However, it's worth noting that historical memory and cultural memory are complex and dynamic processes, and the ways in which individuals are remembered can change over time. It's possible that new discoveries or reinterpretations of Aristotle's works could alter our understanding of his legacy, or that cultural or historical shifts could change the ways in which he is remembered and celebrated.
> 
> Nevertheless, given the enduring impact and significance of Aristotle's contributions to philosophy and science, it's highly unlikely that he would be completely forgotten or faded from our memory and history.
