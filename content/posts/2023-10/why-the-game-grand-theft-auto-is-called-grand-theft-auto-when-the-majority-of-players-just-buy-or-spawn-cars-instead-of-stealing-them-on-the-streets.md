Why the game Grand Theft Auto is called Grand Theft Auto when the majority of players just buy or spawn cars instead of stealing them on the streets?

## ChatGPT
The name "Grand Theft Auto" is derived from the legal term for the crime of stealing a motor vehicle, which is commonly referred to as "grand theft auto." While players in the game do have the option to steal cars, the title encompasses a broader theme of criminal activities and open-world gameplay. In the game, players engage in a wide range of activities beyond just car theft, such as heists, missions, and other criminal pursuits. So, while car theft is a part of the game, the name reflects the criminal underworld and freedom of choice that the game offers to players.
