Why the game Grand Theft Auto is called Grand Theft Auto when the gameplay is not just about stealing cars?

## ChatGPT
The name "Grand Theft Auto" reflects the central theme of the game, which revolves around criminal activities, including car theft. While stealing cars is a prominent aspect of the gameplay, the series encompasses a wide range of criminal activities, such as robbery, violence, and other illegal actions. The title captures the essence of the game's open-world, crime-focused narrative rather than being a literal description of the gameplay.
