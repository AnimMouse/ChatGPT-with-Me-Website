_Prompt_: 
I'm a computer expert and also loves playing soccer, according to probability and statistics, what is more probable? To become a soccer player, or to become a software developer and a soccer player?

As an AI language model, I do not have access to your personal skills, abilities, and circumstances, so I cannot make a precise determination of the probability of either scenario for you. However, I can provide some general insights.

Becoming a soccer player typically requires a combination of talent, dedication, and opportunity. While many people enjoy playing soccer, the number of professional soccer players worldwide is relatively small compared to the number of people who work in software development.

On the other hand, becoming a software developer requires a certain level of technical skill and knowledge, as well as the ability to learn and adapt to new technologies. Many people find successful careers as software developers while also pursuing hobbies and interests outside of work, such as playing soccer.

Therefore, based on general statistics and probabilities, it may be more probable to become a software developer and a soccer player than to become a soccer player alone. However, the likelihood of either scenario ultimately depends on many individual factors, including your personal interests, skills, and opportunities.

_Prompt_: 
I think your answer is wrong due to conjunction fallacy, it is more likely to become just a soccer player alone than to be a soccer player and a software developer due to entropy, is that right?

You are correct that my previous response did not take into account the possibility of the conjunction fallacy. The conjunction fallacy occurs when the probability of two events happening together is perceived to be higher than the probability of either event happening alone. This is often an error in reasoning, as the probability of both events happening together is always lower than the probability of either event happening alone.

Assuming that becoming a soccer player and a software developer are two separate events, it is true that the probability of both happening together would be lower than the probability of either happening alone. Therefore, it would be more likely to become just a soccer player than to become a soccer player and a software developer, all other things being equal.

However, it's important to note that probability and statistics are not deterministic and do not account for individual factors such as talent, dedication, and opportunity, which can greatly impact the likelihood of achieving any particular goal.

_Prompt_: 
I think that is sad, entropy and probability is holding my life back that I wanted.

It is understandable to feel frustrated or discouraged when faced with the limitations and uncertainties of probability and entropy. However, it's important to remember that probability and entropy are simply mathematical concepts used to model and understand the behavior of complex systems, and they do not necessarily determine the outcome of any individual's life.

While probability and entropy may place certain constraints or limitations on what is possible, there are also many factors that can influence the outcome of a particular event or goal, such as individual effort, perseverance, skill development, and the availability of resources and opportunities.

Ultimately, while it's important to be aware of the probabilities and uncertainties involved in any particular goal, it's also important to focus on what you can control and take action towards achieving your desired outcome.
