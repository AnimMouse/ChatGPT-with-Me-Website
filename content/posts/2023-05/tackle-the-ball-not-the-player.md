_Prompt_: 
In football, I performed a sliding tackle to my opponent, and the referee stops the game and my coach said "tackle the ball, not the player", what does my coach means?

When your coach says "tackle the ball, not the player," he means that you should focus on trying to take control of the ball from your opponent rather than trying to take down the player with your tackle. A sliding tackle is a risky move in football, as it can result in a foul or even a red card if you make contact with your opponent instead of the ball.

To perform a successful sliding tackle, you should aim to slide in from the side of your opponent, with your body low to the ground and your foot extended towards the ball. You should aim to make contact with the ball first, using the momentum of your slide to take control of the ball and win possession for your team. By focusing on the ball rather than the player, you can reduce the risk of committing a foul and keep your team on the right side of the referee's decisions.

_Prompt_: 
If I tackled the player, then the player loses the possession of the ball, right?

Yes, if you tackled the player, you might have disrupted their control of the ball and taken possession away from them. However, if the referee deems your tackle to be a foul, it could result in a free kick or even a penalty kick for the opposing team. This is why it's important to focus on tackling the ball instead of the player, as it reduces the risk of committing a foul and ensures that you are playing within the rules of the game. Additionally, tackling the ball directly can also create better opportunities for your team to launch a counter-attack or create a scoring chance, as you would be in possession of the ball after making a successful tackle.
