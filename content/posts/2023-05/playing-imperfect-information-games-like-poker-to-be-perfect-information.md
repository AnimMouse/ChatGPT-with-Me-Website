_Prompt_: 
Is it possible to play imperfect information games like poker to be perfect information like chess by allowing players in poker to see each other cards?

Yes, it is theoretically possible to modify imperfect information games like poker to become perfect information games by allowing players to see each other's cards. In poker, imperfect information arises from the fact that players do not have complete information about the cards held by their opponents. This leads to strategic decisions being made based on incomplete information, such as bluffing and trying to read opponents' behavior.

If players were allowed to see each other's cards in poker, it would remove the element of uncertainty and turn it into a perfect information game, similar to chess, where all information about the game state is known to all players at all times. This would fundamentally change the dynamics and strategies of the game, as players would have complete information to base their decisions on, and bluffing would no longer be effective.

However, it's important to note that the rules of poker, including the element of imperfect information, are what make the game interesting and challenging. Removing imperfect information by allowing players to see each other's cards would fundamentally alter the nature of the game and may not necessarily result in a more enjoyable or strategic experience. The element of uncertainty and the ability to make informed guesses about opponents' hands is a crucial aspect of poker's appeal and strategic depth.
