_Prompt_: 
In Cuban Missile Crisis, who did the first move? USA putting missiles on Turkey, or Soviet Union putting missiles on Cuba?

The first move in the Cuban Missile Crisis was the placement of American missiles in Turkey by the United States. The United States had deployed Jupiter intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Turkey in 1961, which were capable of carrying nuclear warheads and had the range to reach targets in the Soviet Union. The U.S. deployment of missiles in Turkey was part of its strategy to counter the perceived Soviet threat during the Cold War.

In response to the U.S. missiles in Turkey, the Soviet Union initiated the placement of missiles in Cuba. In October 1962, the Soviet Union began secretly deploying ballistic missiles in Cuba, which were capable of reaching the United States. This move by the Soviet Union was seen as a response to the U.S. missile deployment in Turkey, and it triggered the Cuban Missile Crisis, which was a major confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union, bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war. The crisis was eventually resolved through diplomatic negotiations, with the United States agreeing not to invade Cuba and the Soviet Union agreeing to dismantle its missile bases in Cuba, while the United States dismantled its missile bases in Turkey.

_Prompt_: 
Why did it called Cuban Missile Crisis if the first move was made in Turkey? Should be called "Turkey Missile Crisis" instead?

The term "Cuban Missile Crisis" refers to the specific event in 1962 when the Soviet Union placed missiles in Cuba, which led to a tense standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union, with the risk of nuclear war. While the placement of U.S. missiles in Turkey was indeed a triggering factor in the overall context of the Cold War, the term "Cuban Missile Crisis" is used because the crisis itself unfolded primarily in and around Cuba.

The crisis in Cuba captured global attention as it involved the presence of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba, which posed a direct threat to the United States, as Cuba is located in close proximity to the U.S. mainland. The crisis involved intense diplomatic negotiations, a U.S. naval blockade of Cuba, and a heightened risk of nuclear confrontation between the two superpowers, which made it a significant and historic event in world history.

While the placement of U.S. missiles in Turkey was an important factor in the broader context of the Cold War, the term "Cuban Missile Crisis" specifically refers to the events that unfolded during the crisis in Cuba in 1962, which brought the world to the brink of nuclear war and had a profound impact on global politics and diplomacy.
