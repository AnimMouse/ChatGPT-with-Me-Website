_Prompt_: 
In football, I performed a sliding tackle to my opponent, and the referee stops the game and the announcer said "And the whistle is gone for a reckless challenge there." What does the announcer means?

The announcer is referring to your sliding tackle as a "reckless challenge," which means that in the opinion of the referee and the announcer, your tackle was not done safely or within the rules of the game. It is possible that you made contact with your opponent in a dangerous way or used excessive force, which is not allowed in football. As a result, the referee stopped the game and may have given you a warning or a penalty. It's important to play within the rules and avoid making challenges that could harm yourself or others on the field.
