_Prompt_: 
What does this quote mean: "Same things that make us laugh, makes us cry".

The quote "Same things that make us laugh, makes us cry" suggests that there is a connection between humor and sadness. It implies that the emotions we feel when we are happy and when we are sad are not so different, and that they can be triggered by similar experiences or situations.

For example, a joke may be funny because it exaggerates a situation that we have all experienced before, but it may also make us cry because it reminds us of a painful memory or a loss. Similarly, a heartwarming moment may bring tears to our eyes because it touches us deeply, but it may also make us laugh because it is so unexpectedly joyful.

Overall, this quote highlights the complex and interconnected nature of human emotions, suggesting that joy and sorrow are often two sides of the same coin.
