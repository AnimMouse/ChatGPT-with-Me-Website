Is it true that there is no way to account for survivorship bias unless we found a way to talk to the dead?

Survivorship bias is indeed challenging to account for, but it's not impossible. By carefully considering data collection methods, analyzing both successes and failures, and being mindful of selection biases, researchers can mitigate its effects to some extent. While talking to the dead would certainly offer unique insights, practical methods can still help minimize survivorship bias.
