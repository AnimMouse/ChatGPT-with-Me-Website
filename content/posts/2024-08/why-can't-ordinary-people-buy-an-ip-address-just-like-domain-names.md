Why can't ordinary people buy an IP address just like domain names?

The fundamental reason why ordinary people can't buy IP addresses like domain names is rooted in how IP addresses are managed and allocated.
IP addresses are unique numerical identifiers assigned to devices on a network, allowing them to communicate with each other over the internet. These addresses are managed by regional internet registries (RIRs), such as ARIN (American Registry for Internet Numbers), RIPE NCC (Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre), and others around the world. These RIRs are responsible for allocating blocks of IP addresses to internet service providers (ISPs), organizations, and other entities based on certain criteria.
Unlike domain names, which are managed by registrars and can be purchased by individuals or organizations, IP addresses are allocated based on need and specific criteria set by the RIRs. This allocation process ensures efficient use of the limited IPv4 address space and helps prevent address exhaustion.
Additionally, IP addresses are typically leased rather than owned outright. Internet service providers and organizations obtain IP addresses through allocation or assignment from the RIRs and then distribute them to their customers or internal networks as needed. This leasing model allows for more flexibility in managing IP address usage and helps prevent hoarding or monopolization of addresses.
Overall, the hierarchical and regulated nature of IP address allocation, combined with the need for efficient management and conservation of address space, means that IP addresses are not available for individual purchase like domain names.
