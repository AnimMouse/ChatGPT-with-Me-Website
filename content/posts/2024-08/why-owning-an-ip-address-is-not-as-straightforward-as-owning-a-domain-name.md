Why owning an IP address is not as straightforward as owning a domain name?

Owning an IP address is not as straightforward as owning a domain name because IP addresses are a limited resource managed by regional internet registries (RIRs) and Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Here are a few reasons why it's more complex:

1. Scarcity: There are only a limited number of IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) addresses available, and they've nearly run out. IPv6 addresses are now in use to alleviate this scarcity, but transitioning to IPv6 takes time.
2. Hierarchical Structure: IP addresses have a hierarchical structure. RIRs (like ARIN for North America, RIPE NCC for Europe, etc.) allocate IP address blocks to ISPs, who then assign them to organizations and individuals. This hierarchy means ownership is distributed across these levels.
3. Leasing vs. Ownership: Most often, when you "own" an IP address, you're leasing it from an ISP or provider. They maintain ownership of the block of addresses and delegate specific ones to customers.
4.Technical Considerations: Unlike domain names, IP addresses are critical for routing data across the internet. Mismanagement or conflicts with IP addresses can lead to network issues.Legal and Regulatory Aspects: There are legal and regulatory considerations involved in IP address ownership, especially in terms of misuse, security, and compliance with regional internet governance rules.
5. Dynamic vs. Static: IP addresses can be dynamic (changing periodically) or static (unchanging). Static IPs, often needed for specific applications, require more configuration and may involve additional costs.

So, while you can "own" an IP address in the sense that you're using it exclusively, the actual ownership is more about allocation and usage rights within a structured system managed by regional authorities and ISPs. In contrast, domain names are registered through registrars, and as long as you renew your registration, you have exclusive rights to that domain name.
