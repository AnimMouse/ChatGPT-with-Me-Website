I think DRM is stupid and only hurts paying customers. I have a TV without Widevine DRM and a Netflix subscription, and I can only stream at 480p. I downloaded Kodi and used a torrent to download and play pirated movies, and I can't believe I can stream at 4K HDR with Dolby TrueHD. Are we just punishing paying customers with DRM?

> DRM (Digital Rights Management) is a complex topic with many different perspectives and arguments. However, it is true that DRM can sometimes have unintended negative consequences for paying customers, such as limiting the quality of their streaming experience or making it difficult to transfer content between devices.
> 
> The intention of DRM is to protect the intellectual property rights of content creators and distributors by preventing unauthorized copying, sharing, and distribution of their content. Unfortunately, DRM can also create a frustrating user experience for paying customers who want to use their purchased content on multiple devices, or who may encounter compatibility issues with DRM-protected content.
> 
> Piracy is not a solution to the issues caused by DRM. While pirated content may not have DRM restrictions, it is illegal and unethical to obtain content without proper authorization or payment. It also does not support the creators and distributors of the content, who rely on revenue from legitimate purchases to fund their work.
> 
> There are ongoing discussions and debates about the best approach to DRM and how it can be balanced with the needs and desires of paying customers. Some argue that a more open approach to content distribution, with fewer DRM restrictions, could actually help reduce piracy by making legitimate purchases more attractive and convenient for customers. Others argue that stronger DRM measures are necessary to protect the rights of content creators and distributors, especially in an increasingly digital and global market.
> 
> Ultimately, it's up to each individual to make their own choices about how they consume and access digital content. However, it's important to recognize the potential consequences of those choices and to support the creation and distribution of content in a legal and ethical manner.

But technically I did not "pirate" since I have a Netfix subscription, I just downloaded it from torrents that allow me to stream at 4K, right?

> Downloading content from torrents without proper authorization or payment is still considered piracy, even if you have a Netflix subscription. The fact that you obtained the content from an unauthorized source, rather than through Netflix's licensed distribution channels, means that you did not pay for the right to use that content.
> 
> Moreover, the quality of the content obtained through piracy is not guaranteed, and it may contain viruses or malware that can harm your device or compromise your personal information. Therefore, it is still important to obtain digital content through legal channels to support content creators and ensure that you have a safe and secure experience.

But how can I support content creators if they only allow me to stream their content at 480p because of their stupid DRM?

> It's understandable to feel frustrated with DRM restrictions that limit the quality of your streaming experience. However, downloading content from unauthorized sources is not the solution, as it does not support the content creators or the legitimate distribution channels.
> 
> One way to support content creators is to voice your concerns and preferences to them directly. Many content creators and distributors have customer service channels or social media accounts where you can provide feedback and suggestions. By communicating with them about the impact of DRM restrictions on your viewing experience, you can help them understand the needs and desires of their audience and work towards finding a more balanced solution.
> 
> Another way to support content creators is to explore other legitimate distribution channels that may offer higher-quality streaming options. For example, some streaming services offer higher quality options for an additional fee, or you may be able to purchase or rent the content through a different platform that offers better quality options.
> 
> Ultimately, it's important to remember that content creators rely on revenue from legitimate purchases to fund their work, and downloading content from unauthorized sources does not support their efforts. While it can be frustrating to deal with DRM restrictions, it's important to explore legal and ethical solutions that support both content creators and paying customers.

Do they really want me to ditch my own TV and buy a new TV with DRM so that I can play 4K content?

> Content creators and distributors generally do not want to force consumers to purchase new devices or equipment to access their content. However, they may implement DRM restrictions to protect their intellectual property rights and prevent unauthorized distribution or piracy of their content.
> 
> It's important to note that DRM technologies are often imposed by the content owners, rather than the device manufacturers or streaming platforms themselves. In the case of Netflix, the requirement for Widevine DRM is imposed by the content owners, who want to ensure that their content is protected from unauthorized copying or distribution.
> 
> While it can be frustrating to deal with DRM restrictions, it's important to remember that content creators and distributors rely on revenue from legitimate purchases to fund their work. By purchasing content through legitimate channels and supporting content creators, you help to ensure the continued availability and quality of the content you enjoy.
> 
> If you do want to upgrade to a new TV or device that supports the necessary DRM technologies, you can explore options that fit your budget and needs. However, it's important to prioritize your own financial and practical considerations, rather than feeling pressured to upgrade solely to access higher-quality content.

I think my money is going to waste on Netflix subscription with that stupid DRM that stops me from streaming 4K content.

> It's understandable to feel frustrated that you are paying for a Netflix subscription but are unable to stream content at the highest available quality. However, it's important to recognize that Netflix's DRM requirements are often imposed by content owners to protect their intellectual property rights and prevent unauthorized distribution or piracy of their content.
> 
> Netflix offers a variety of subscription plans at different price points, and the higher-priced plans often offer access to higher quality streaming options, including 4K content. If you are willing to pay more for a subscription plan that offers 4K streaming, you may be able to access higher quality content without resorting to piracy or other unauthorized sources.
> 
> Alternatively, you may also consider exploring other legitimate streaming services or platforms that offer higher quality streaming options without the same DRM restrictions. However, it's important to prioritize legal and ethical means of accessing content, rather than resorting to piracy or other unauthorized methods that can harm content creators and distributors.
> 
> Ultimately, it's up to each individual to decide how they want to spend their money and access content. However, it's important to recognize the potential consequences of these choices and to support the creation and distribution of content in a legal and ethical manner.

Is there an alternative to Netflix without those stupid DRM?

> Many legitimate streaming services do require some form of DRM to protect the content from unauthorized distribution and piracy. However, some streaming services may have more flexible DRM policies or offer higher quality streaming options at a lower price point.
> 
> Some potential alternatives to Netflix that you may want to consider include:
> 
> 1. Amazon Prime Video: This streaming service offers a variety of movies and TV shows, including exclusive content, and supports 4K and HDR streaming on compatible devices.
> 2. Hulu: This service offers a range of popular TV shows and movies, as well as live TV streaming options, and supports HD streaming on compatible devices.
> 3. Disney+: This service offers a selection of popular movies and TV shows from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars, and supports 4K and HDR streaming on compatible devices.
> 4. HBO Max: This service offers a range of popular TV shows and movies from HBO, as well as original content, and supports 4K and HDR streaming on compatible devices.
> 
> It's important to note that while these services may offer more flexible DRM policies or higher quality streaming options, they still require legal and ethical means of accessing the content. Additionally, the availability and quality of content may vary depending on your location and device compatibility, so it's important to do your research and choose a streaming service that fits your needs and preferences.

They use DRM to protect from piracy, and yet I can stream at 4K from torrents, are DRM just straight-up broken at this point?

> While DRM technologies are intended to protect content from unauthorized distribution and piracy, they are not foolproof and can sometimes be circumvented.
> 
> It's important to recognize that downloading and streaming content from unauthorized sources, such as torrents, is not only illegal but also potentially harmful to content creators and distributors who rely on revenue from legitimate purchases to fund their work. In addition, unauthorized sources may offer lower quality or compromised versions of the content, which can impact the overall viewing experience.
> 
> While it's true that some DRM technologies have been circumvented, this does not mean that DRM is entirely broken or useless. Rather, it's a reminder that DRM is just one part of a larger effort to protect intellectual property and prevent unauthorized distribution and piracy.
> 
> Content creators and distributors are constantly working to improve their DRM technologies and develop new methods of protecting their content from piracy. While these efforts may not be perfect, they are an important part of ensuring that content creators and distributors can continue to produce and distribute high-quality content to audiences around the world.
