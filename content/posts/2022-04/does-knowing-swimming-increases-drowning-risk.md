Is it true that a person who knows how to swim has higher chances of drowning than a person who does not know how to swim?

> No, it is not true that a person who knows how to swim has higher chances of drowning than a person who does not know how to swim. In fact, knowing how to swim can significantly reduce the risk of drowning in many situations.
> 
> Swimming is a valuable skill that allows individuals to safely navigate bodies of water and potentially save their lives or the lives of others in emergency situations. However, it is important to note that even strong swimmers can still drown if they are not mindful of potential dangers and take appropriate precautions, such as wearing a life jacket in open water.
> 
> According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), drowning is the fifth leading cause of unintentional injury death in the United States, and knowing how to swim is one of the most effective ways to prevent drowning. It is important for everyone, regardless of their swimming ability, to always practice water safety and take appropriate precautions to reduce the risk of drowning.

Give a statistic on how many people who died drowning that knows how to swim vs those who don't know how to swim.

> According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it is difficult to determine the exact number of drowning deaths among people who know how to swim versus those who do not. However, the CDC reports that in the United States, about 10 people die from unintentional drowning every day, and of these, approximately 80% are adults and two-thirds of them are males.
> 
> While it is not possible to determine how many of these drowning victims knew how to swim, it is clear that knowing how to swim can greatly reduce the risk of drowning. Additionally, other factors such as alcohol use, lack of supervision, and failure to wear a life jacket are often contributing factors in drowning deaths, regardless of the victim's swimming ability.

It is said that a person who knows how to swim will swim more than a non-swimmer, so their chances of drowning is higher, right?

> It is not necessarily true that a person who knows how to swim will swim more than a non-swimmer, and therefore have a higher chance of drowning. While it is true that individuals who know how to swim may be more likely to participate in water-related activities, it does not necessarily follow that their risk of drowning is higher.
> 
> In fact, individuals who know how to swim and have received proper water safety training may be better equipped to recognize and avoid potential hazards in and around the water. They may also be more likely to use appropriate safety equipment, such as life jackets, and to swim in designated areas with lifeguards present.
> 
> On the other hand, individuals who do not know how to swim may be more likely to panic and struggle in the water, which can increase their risk of drowning. Additionally, non-swimmers may be less aware of water safety rules and may be more likely to engage in risky behaviors around water.
> 
> Ultimately, the risk of drowning depends on a variety of factors, including an individual's swimming ability, knowledge of water safety, and their behavior and choices around water. It is important for everyone, regardless of their swimming ability, to take appropriate precautions and to follow water safety guidelines to reduce the risk of drowning.
