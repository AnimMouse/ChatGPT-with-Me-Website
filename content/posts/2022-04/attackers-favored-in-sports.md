Why in sports, attackers are more favored than defenders?

> In many sports, attackers are often favored over defenders for a few different reasons:
> 
> 1. Scoring is the ultimate goal: In most sports, the primary objective is to score more points than the opponent. Attackers are the ones who are responsible for scoring those points, so they are naturally going to be more highly valued.
> 2. Entertainment value: Fans often enjoy watching high-scoring games with lots of action. Attackers tend to be more involved in the exciting and dramatic moments of a game, such as breakaways, scoring chances, and goals.
> 3. Rule changes: In some sports, rule changes have made it easier for attackers to score. For example, in soccer, the offside rule has been modified to allow attackers to be onside if they are level with the last defender, which makes it easier for them to get in behind the defense and create scoring opportunities.
> 4. Physical demands: Defending can be physically taxing and require a lot of endurance, while attacking can involve more bursts of speed and explosiveness. This can make attacking positions more attractive to athletes who are looking to maximize their potential and reduce the risk of injury.
> 
> Overall, attackers tend to be more favored in many sports because of their ability to score and provide excitement for fans. However, this doesn't mean that defenders aren't important, as they play a crucial role in preventing the other team from scoring and helping their own team win.
