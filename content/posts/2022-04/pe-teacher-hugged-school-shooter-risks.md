There is a student with a gun and about to commit a school shooting, a PE teacher approached the student that has a gun and hugged him, preventing the student from committing a school shooting, did the PE teacher did the right thing, or did he just committed a risky act and we should not try to be a hero?

> In this situation, it's understandable to feel conflicted about what the appropriate action should be. However, based on the limited information given, it's difficult to determine whether the PE teacher's actions were appropriate or not.

> It's important to note that situations involving firearms can be incredibly dangerous and unpredictable, and attempting to intervene can potentially put oneself and others at risk. The best course of action in such situations is to contact law enforcement immediately and follow their instructions.

> With that being said, the PE teacher's decision to approach the student and hug him may have diffused the situation and prevented harm from occurring. However, this is a risky approach that may not have been effective in other situations, and it's generally not recommended as a course of action in such scenarios.

> Ultimately, the most important thing in these situations is to prioritize the safety of all individuals involved. It's important to have a plan in place for how to respond to potential threats, and to follow established protocols to ensure the safety of everyone involved.
