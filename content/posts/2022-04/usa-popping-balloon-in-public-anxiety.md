Why in USA, a sound of popping balloon in public will trigger a panic?

> The sound of popping balloons can trigger panic in certain situations in the United States due to a phenomenon called "mass shooting anxiety" or "active shooter anxiety." This is a type of anxiety that has become more prevalent in the United States due to the frequency of mass shootings in public places such as schools, movie theaters, and shopping centers.
> 
> As a result, people in the United States are often on high alert when they are in public places, especially those with large crowds. Loud, sudden noises like the sound of a popping balloon can be mistaken for gunfire, which can trigger panic and anxiety in those who are already on edge.
> 
> In addition, many schools and other public places have implemented active shooter drills and training sessions, which can also contribute to heightened anxiety around sudden loud noises. Participants in these drills are often taught to react quickly and decisively to any loud noises, which can lead to a sense of urgency and heightened anxiety in real-world situations.
> 
> Overall, the sound of a popping balloon can trigger panic in the United States due to a combination of factors, including the prevalence of mass shootings, heightened anxiety in public places, and active shooter training and drills.

Is it OK to pop a balloon in public? What should I do to lower the sound?

> It's generally best to avoid popping balloons in public places, particularly in crowded areas, as the loud noise can startle people and potentially trigger panic or anxiety in some individuals. However, if you must pop a balloon, there are a few things you can do to help lower the sound:
> 
> 1. Try to muffle the sound by holding the balloon tightly against a soft surface, like a pillow or cushion, before popping it.
> 2. Consider using a small needle or pin to puncture the balloon instead of popping it, as this can create a quieter sound.
> 3. Look for areas where the noise won't be as disruptive, such as outside or in a less crowded area.
> 4. Consider giving a warning to those around you that you will be popping the balloon, so they have time to prepare themselves for the sound.
> 
> Regardless of how you choose to pop a balloon, it's important to be considerate of those around you and to keep in mind that sudden loud noises can be distressing for some people.
