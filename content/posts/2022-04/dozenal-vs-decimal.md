Is counting on dozenal better than decimal?

> Whether counting on dozenal (base-12) is better than counting on decimal (base-10) depends on what you mean by "better." Here are some factors to consider:
> 
> 1. Ease of Use: Decimal is the most widely used system of counting in the world, which means that most people are familiar with it and find it easy to use. However, for those who are used to counting in dozenal, it may be just as easy or easier than counting in decimal.
> 2. Math Operations: Some people argue that dozenal is better than decimal for performing math operations because it has more factors (2, 3, 4, 6) compared to decimal (2, 5), which can make certain calculations simpler. For example, in dozenal, 1/3 can be expressed as 0.4, which is a finite decimal, whereas in decimal, 1/3 is a repeating decimal.
> 3. Language and Culture: Some languages and cultures have historical roots in dozenal counting, such as the ancient Babylonians, who used a base-60 counting system. In these contexts, dozenal may be more culturally significant and easier to understand than decimal.
> 4. Compatibility: Decimal is the standard system of counting used in most modern technology, including computers and calculators. While it's possible to program computers and calculators to count in dozenal, it may not be as practical or efficient as using decimal.
> 
> Overall, whether dozenal or decimal is "better" depends on the context and the needs of the user. While dozenal may have some advantages over decimal in certain situations, decimal is the most widely used and practical system of counting for most purposes.

Is it hard to start counting using dozenal from decimal?

> It may be challenging at first to start counting using dozenal if you're used to counting in decimal, but with practice, it can become easier. Here are some tips to help make the transition:
> 
> 1. Learn the dozenal digits: In dozenal, there are 12 digits, which are represented by the numbers 0-9 and two additional symbols usually represented by '↊' and '↋'. It's important to become familiar with these symbols and how they correspond to decimal digits.
> 2. Practice conversion: To get comfortable with dozenal, it can be helpful to practice converting numbers from decimal to dozenal and vice versa. You can use an online converter or a dozenal calculator to check your work.
> 3. Understand dozenal multiplication and division: In dozenal, multiplication and division can be different than in decimal because there are more factors available. For example, in dozenal, 2 and 6 are factors of 12, which can make certain calculations simpler.
> 4. Practice counting: Start by counting to 12 in dozenal and then progress to larger numbers. It may be helpful to write out the numbers and practice saying them aloud.
> 5. Use dozenal in context: Once you've become more comfortable with dozenal, try using it in practical contexts, such as measuring and counting objects in a dozenal system.
> 
> With consistent practice and effort, counting using dozenal can become more natural and comfortable, even if you're used to counting in decimal.
