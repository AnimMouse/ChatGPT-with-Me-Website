Parental care is indeed a significant factor that has contributed to the success of mammals in dominating the world. Mammals are characterized by their ability to provide extensive and prolonged parental care to their offspring. This care can take various forms, including nursing, protection, teaching, and providing food and shelter.

The provision of parental care offers several advantages to mammals. It increases the survival rates of their offspring by ensuring they receive adequate nourishment and protection during their early stages of development. This investment in offspring survival enhances the chances of their genes being passed on to subsequent generations. By taking care of their young, mammals can increase the overall fitness of their species.

In contrast, many other animal classes, such as reptiles, amphibians, and most fish, typically exhibit limited or no parental care. Once their eggs are laid or their young are born, these animals often do not provide any additional support or protection. This lack of parental care can result in higher mortality rates for their offspring, as they are left to fend for themselves at an early stage.

The absence of extensive parental care in other animal classes can limit their ability to compete with mammals in certain environments. Mammals' ability to care for and protect their young allows them to colonize diverse habitats and exploit a wide range of ecological niches. This has played a crucial role in the evolutionary success and global dominance of mammals.

However, it's important to note that the dominance of mammals cannot be solely attributed to parental care. Other factors, such as their highly adaptable nature, diverse feeding strategies, and complex social behaviors, have also contributed to their ecological success. Nonetheless, parental care has undoubtedly played a significant role in enabling mammals to thrive and become the most diverse class of vertebrates on Earth.
