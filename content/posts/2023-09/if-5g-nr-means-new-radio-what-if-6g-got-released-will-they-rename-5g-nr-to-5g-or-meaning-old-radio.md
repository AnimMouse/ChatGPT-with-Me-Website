If 5G NR means New Radio, what if 6G got released? Will they rename 5G NR to 5G OR meaning Old Radio?

The naming conventions for wireless technologies are not necessarily based on chronological order or a direct reflection of the technology's advancement. While "NR" in 5G NR does stand for "New Radio," it doesn't imply that a hypothetical 6G technology would be called "Old Radio" or "OR."

When new generations of wireless technology are developed, the naming is typically based on marketing decisions, technical specifications, and industry standards. For example, the "G" in 5G and 6G stands for "generation." If 6G were to be introduced in the future, it would likely be named with a distinct identifier that doesn't imply obsolescence or refer to previous generations.

It's worth noting that as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, 6G technology is still in the early research and development stage. The actual name and specifications for 6G have not been standardized or widely agreed upon yet. The wireless industry will likely determine the name and branding for 6G when it is closer to being deployed.
