Is USB a country next to USA?

## ChatGPT
No, USB is not a country next to the USA. USB stands for "Universal Serial Bus," which is a standard technology used for connecting various devices to computers, such as keyboards, mice, printers, and external storage devices. It is not a geographical location or a country. The USA (United States of America) is a country located in North America, bordered by Canada to the north and Mexico to the south.
