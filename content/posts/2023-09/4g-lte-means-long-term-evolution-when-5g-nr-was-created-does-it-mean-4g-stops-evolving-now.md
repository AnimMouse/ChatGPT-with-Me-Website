No, the creation of 5G NR (New Radio) does not mean that 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution) stops evolving. The term "Long Term Evolution" refers to the ongoing development and enhancements made to the 4G network technology. LTE has gone through several releases, such as LTE Advanced (LTE-A) and LTE Advanced Pro (LTE-A Pro), which brought improvements in terms of speed, capacity, and efficiency.

With the introduction of 5G NR, a new generation of wireless technology has emerged, offering even higher speeds, lower latency, and increased capacity compared to 4G LTE. However, 4G LTE networks continue to evolve and are still widely used globally. Service providers and network operators continue to invest in improving and expanding their 4G networks to provide reliable connectivity, especially in areas where 5G coverage is limited or not yet available.

Both 4G LTE and 5G NR will coexist for some time, with 5G gradually becoming more prevalent and eventually replacing 4G as the dominant network technology. However, 4G LTE will likely continue to receive optimizations, updates, and improvements to ensure its performance and compatibility as networks transition to 5G.
