What is the purpose of alibi in court? Are we should be proving guilt instead of innocence?

## ChatGPT
The purpose of an alibi in court is to provide evidence that the accused was not at the scene of the crime when it occurred, therefore suggesting they couldn't have committed the offense. In a criminal trial, the burden of proof lies with the prosecution, who must demonstrate the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. It is not the defendant's responsibility to prove their innocence; rather, the legal system presumes them innocent until proven guilty. The defense may present an alibi as part of their strategy to cast doubt on the prosecution's case and show that the defendant could not have committed the crime.
