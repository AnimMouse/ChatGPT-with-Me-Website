Will a UFO congress hearing help reduce USA political polarization?

## ChatGPT
While a UFO congress hearing could generate interest and bring people together to discuss a common topic, it's unlikely to directly reduce political polarization in the USA. Political polarization is a complex issue influenced by various factors, such as ideology, social identity, media, and more. While a UFO congress hearing might foster some curiosity and engagement, it may not address the root causes of polarization. To effectively reduce political polarization, a comprehensive and sustained effort from various sectors of society would be necessary.
